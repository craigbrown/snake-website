                    <h2>What is Oh No Snake?</h2>
                    <div class="text-inner">
                        <p>
                            In a remote village somewhere far away, villagers are going about their day, enjoying their peaceful, snake-free existence. Everything is perfect - villagers remain unbitten, mice remain uneaten. It's only a matter of time before this utopia is disturbed. One fateful day, a small boy looks down and sees you slithering through the undergrowth. His eyes widen, his finger points, and drawing his breath he screams - "OH NO SNAKE!!"
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Oh No Snake, you must move through the village without getting hit by the villager's sticks, while trying to eat as many apples as possible. But beware - the more villagers you avoid, the quicker you'll have to be!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>How do I play the game?</h2>
                    <div class="text-inner">
                        <p>
                            Tap to move forwards or swipe left/right to move Snake in that direction. You get points by successfully moving past a stick, or by eating apples. Try to get as many points as possible for a high score!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>What do those power-ups do?</h2>
                    <div class="text-inner">
                        <p>
                            Power-ups are objects that Snake can find on its journey. The apple will give you an extra point, Micearoni will make you invincible (but not for long!), and the Snake Charm will briefly slow down time. Look out for the rare Snake Heads too - they'll give you an extra life if you can find them!
